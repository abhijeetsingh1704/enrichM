Welcome to EnrichM's documentation!
===================================
EnrichM is a set of tools for annotating metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs),
and comparing their functional composition by calculating enrichment statistics 
between user-defined groups.  EnrichM also provides functions to generate
metabolic networks for sets of genomes or metagenomes that are cytoscape
readable. The network generating scripts can be used on genomes, assemblies,
but can also be used to integrate metagenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic
data.EnrichM is under GPL3 v3, and is available on GitHub. For support or inquiries,
please either leave an issue on the GitHub page or post on the M tools supportpage:
